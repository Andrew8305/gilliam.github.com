      <p>The model is quite simple and flexible: Services are grouped
	in formations. Code is built into an image and combined with
	configuration to form a release.  From this release instances
	are created and Gilliam will make sure that they keep
	running.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

</div> <!-- End of top container -->
<div class="light">
  
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Formations</h2>
      <p>A formation ties together some business logic with its
      dependencies into a named group. Everything is a service, either
      exposed to other services and formations, or internal. Examples
      of internal services are databases and caches.

      <p>In micro service architectures a service is really small and
	perform a single task.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Builder</h2>
      <p>The builder is responsible for taking code and bundling it
	with its dependencies and run-time into an <i>image</i>.</p>

      <p>When the <code>gilliam deploy</code> command is issued the
	complete source tree of the service will be tar:ed up and sent
	to the builder, which will feed it into a buildpack. Its up to
	the buildpack to gather dependencies and prepare the image.
	When done, the whole thing is assembled into an image and a
	new release is created for the service.</p>

      <p>Gilliams architecture do not require a special build server,
	but the builder is a convenient way of creating images and
	releasing them.  One can envision other ways of getting code
	into a release; <code>git push</code> or maybe a Jenkins
	job.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Services</h2>
      <p>Borrowing from dotCloud, the <code>gilliam.yml</code> file
	defines services that will live in your formation.  Each
	service has a type, which specifies how it will be built and
	deployed. If not specified, services default to
	the <i>custom</i> type which will try to build the service
	using a Buildpack.</p>

     <p>Services run in resource constrained, isolated, ephemeral
       environments provided by the hypervisor. If services need to
       share or persist state it should be done outside of the
       container, like in a database or a cache.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Scheduler</h2>
      <p>The scheduler is the heart of Gilliam. It is the component
	that is make sure that the desired number of instances are
	running for your services. It constantly talks to the
	executors and monitor their state.</p>

      <p>Instances are currently spread in a random fashion over all
	executors.</p>

      <p>The scheduler provides a simple RESTful API to manage
	formations, releases and instances. This is the API that
	<i>gilliam-cli</i> uses when you issue <code>migrate</code>
	or <code>scale</code> commands.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>A custom service is built, with all its runtime dependencies,
	into an immutable Docker image.  The image will be pushed to
	a registry.  Later, when an instance is spawned or migrated,
	the image will get pulled into the executor and launched.</p>

      <p>Gilliam doesn't care if you store your images on a private
	registry or on the offical Docker one.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Executor</h2>
      <p>This is the component that actually executes your code.  It
	is mostly an API around a Docker daemon, but it also provides
	some functionality that is essential to the platform. Like
	logging and the HTTP proxy that allows services to easily talk
	to other services without having to integate with any
	platform-specific libraries or tools.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Configuration</h2>
      <p>The platform doesn't really dictate how configuration is
	managed, but it is encouraged to use environment variables.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Auxiliary Services</h2>
      <p>Databases, caches and other internal services that are 
	not your own are called auxiliary services. These services
	are not different in any way, expect that they should not
	be exposed outside of the formation.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Releases</h2>
      <p>A release is the combination of code and environment, and it
	is the thing that is actually deployed. A new release is
	created every time new code is pushed or when environment
	variables is changed.</p>

      <img style="margin-left: 150px;" src="images/release.png"></img>

      <p>By being the deployable unit, it is on a release that you set
	scale factors. This means that it is possible to have multiple
	releases deployed at the same time, allowing partial and
	gradiual roll out of changes.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Scale Factors</h2>
      <p>Scale factors are set on a release and will instruct the
	scheduler to try to make sure that the specified number of
	instances for each service is always running.</p>
