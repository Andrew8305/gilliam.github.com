      <p>The model is quite simple and flexible: Process types are

      configuration to form a release.  From this release processes
      are created and Gilliam will make sure that they keep
      running.</p>

      <h2>Services (AKA "apps")</h2>
      <p>Services (internally called "apps", of course) is the thing
      that you as a developer build and deploy.  Normally it exposes
      some kind of interface or API that other parties or clients can
      use to communicate with the service. In turn, it may talk to
      other services and attached resources such as database or
      queues.</p>

      <p>In micro service architectures a service is really small and
	perform a single task.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Builder</h2>
      <p>The builder is responsible for taking code and bundling it
	with its dependencies and run-time into an <i>image</i>.</p>

      <p>When the <code>gilliam deploy</code> command is issued the
	complete source tree of the service will be tar:ed up and sent
	to the builder, which will feed it into a buildpack. Its up to
	the buildpack to gather dependencies and prepare the image.
	When done, the whole thing is assembled into an image and a
	new release is created for the service.</p>

      <p>Gilliams architecture do not require a special build server,
	but the builder is a convenient way of creating images and
	releasing them.  One can envision other ways of getting code
	into a release; <code>git push</code> or maybe a Jenkins
	job.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Processes</h2>
      <p>Borrowing from Heroku, the <code>Procfile</code> defines what
      you want to run in your service. The file contains <i>process
      types</i>, which is declarations of commands that will execute when
      a process of that type is started. The procfile is a YAML file that
      lives in the root of your service:</p>

<div class="highlight">
  <pre><code class="clj"><span class="nf">web</span>: python web.py
<span class="nf">worker</span>: python worker.py</code></pre></div>

     <p>Processes run in resource constrained, isolated, ephemeral
       environments provided by the hypervisor. If processes need to
       share state it should be done outside of the container, like in
       a database or a cache.</p>

     <p>For local development a number of tools exist to launch
       processes from a procfile. The most known one is probably
       <a href="http://blog.daviddollar.org/2011/05/06/introducing-foreman.html">Foreman</a>.
       </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Scheduler</h2>
      <p>The scheduler is the heart of Gilliam. It is the component that
	is make sure that the desired number of processes are running
	for your services. It constantly talks to the hypervisors and
	monitor their state.</p>

      <img style="margin-left: 80px;" src="images/scheduler.png"></img>

      <p>Processes are currently spread in a random fashion over all
	hypervisors.</p>

      <p>The scheduler provides a simple RESTful API to manage
	services, releases and processes. This is the API that the
	client uses when you issue <code>config</code>
	or <code>scale</code> commands.</p>

      <p>Simple in its design, the scheduler is completely agnostic to
	image formats and virtualization techniques.  The image format
	is defined by a contract between the build processes and the
	hypervisor.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Images</h2>
      <p>A service is processed and bundled with its run-time and
	dependencies into an immutable <i>image</i>.  This image can
	later be deployed to hypervisors and will act as the
	environment for the processes. The same image will be used
	for all stages, from testing to production.</p>

      <img style="margin-left: 60px;" src="images/image-repository.png"></img>

      <p>Images are stored in some kind of repository. It can be
	Amazon S3 or something else that can serve content using HTTP.
	Currently the builder provides repository functionality.  The
	image will be downloaded to the hypervisor when a process is
	created.  To speed up consecutive launches, images are
	cached.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Hypervisor</h2>
      <p>This is the component that puts your image into some kind of
	container, in our case <a href="http://lxc.sf.net/">LXC</a>,
	and start a process in it.</p>
      <p>It is the hypervisors job to monitor spawned processes and
	report state back to the scheduler.  It is also responsible
	for providing the functionality of the platform that resides
	outside of the container, like logging.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Configuration</h2>
      <p>To minimize differences between testing and production
	environments the same software image is used for all stages.
	But the service will most likely need some configuration that
	will not always be the same, like database credentials or
	pointers to external resources.</p>

      <p>Configuration is controlled using the <code>gilliam</code>
	command-line client:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code>$ gilliam config <span class="nf">POOL_SIZE=32</span>
v13 released
</code></pre></div>

      <p>Following the 12 factor methodology, configuration is passed
	to the process in environment variables.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Auxiliary Services</h2>
      <p>Currently Gilliam do not have any specific functionality for
	supporting auxiliary services like databases, queues or
	caches.  This is something that is planned for the future, but
	lets get the basics in place first.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="sixcol">
      <h2>Releases</h2>
      <p>A release is the combination of code and configuration, and it is
	the thing that is actually deployed. A new release is created every
	time new code is pushed or when configuration is changed.</p>

      <img style="margin-left: 150px;" src="images/release.png"></img>

      <p>By being the deployable unit, it is on a release that you set
	scale factors. This means that it is possible to have multiple
	releases deployed at the same time, allowing partial and
	gradiual roll out of changes.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="sixcol last">
      <h2>Scale Factors</h2>
      <p>Scale factors are set on a release and will instruct the
	scheduler to try to make sure that the specified number of
	processes for each type is always running.</p>

      <img style="margin-left: 100px;" src="images/process-types.png"></img>
